Dear {&RecipientName},

<p>Please find attached your department’s Employee Business Expense Overview. This is a point-in-time dashboard that reflects the last 13 months of spending through our expense management system. In addition to this dashboard, you will continue to receive the Employee Business Expense Monthly Activity report summarizing prior month audit and card activity.</p>

<p>To view daily expenses as items are submitted, visit <a href="http://yourcompany.com/expenses">yourcompany.com/expenses</a> and explore the sections for your department’s high-level expense details. As it reflects only data from our expense management system, the dashboard <b>does not</b> replace any monthly reporting by Finance or accounting, which includes all sources of expenses charged to your department.</p>
 
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>
 
Thanks,<br>
<p>Finance Team</p>
